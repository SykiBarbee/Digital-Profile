<h2>Technical Writing</h2>

<p><a class="button" href="pdf/grant%20proposal.pdf">
    
<b>Grant Proposal:You Are Loved (PDF) </b></a>
         <br>
 
      I wrote this 25 page grant proposal for my Intro to Professional Writing and Technical Communication class. The proposal for this grant was to provide a hotel sized residence for homeless and at risk LGBTQ youth. We were supposed to act on behalf of an organization that needed funding for projects they needed to complete.</p>
    
<h2>Academic Writing</h2>

<p><a class="button" href="pdf/representation.pdf"><b>Black Representation in the United States: Past , Present and Future (PDF)</b></a> <br>

   I wrote this 19 page research paper for my Ideas That Change the World honors class. After watching Black Panther, and seeing Black Americans joyous and proud of their heritage made me want to write this paper. Everyone wants to be able to watch television, movies, music, theater and magazines with people who look like them. Black Americans have not had to luxury to see themselves represented in positive, non-stereotypical roles, with the exception of a few television shows (Fresh Prince and The Cosby Show).</p>

<p><a class="button" href="pdf/Shakespeare.pdf"><b>The Unmasking Of King Henry V in Shakespeare's <i>Henry V</i> (PDF)</b></a> <br>
    
    Spring semester of 2019 I took an Advanced Shakespeare course where we extensively read and analyzed <i>Henry V</i>. For my final research paper, I decided to focus on King Henry's character. I took on the debate amongst many Shakespearean critics where Henry Vis either seen as a noble Christian King with great military prowess, or a machiavellian King whose ego outweighs his duty to his kingdom. My research has led me to agree with the latter critics. However, I also acknowledge that he has potential to be the former, if only he sets his ego aside, and takes accountablity for his choices. </p>

<h2>Creative Writing</h2>
    
<p><a class="button" href="pdf/play.pdf"><b>Elizabethan 5 Act Play (PDF) </b></a> <br>
   
     I wrote this play called A Witchâ€™s Revenge for my Creative Writing for Theatre class back in 2016. The entire play is written in iambic pentameter which was a challenge. The writing of this play opened revealed a passion for writing plays that I never considered before.</p>
    
<p><a class="button" href="pdf/Deerfield%20Massacre%20The%20Story%20of%20Esther%20Pomeroy.pdf"><b>Deerfield Massacre: The Story of Esther Pomeroy(PDF)</b></a><br>

    I wrote this 16 page short historical fiction piece about a real woman from Deerfield whose story was never told. The only information given about Esther was her husband, children and her birth and death day. Because I was a Creative Writing Major at Holyoke Community College, my professors allowed me to write this creative fiction as my final project.</p>
