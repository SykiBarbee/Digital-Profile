       Hello everyone! My name is Syki. I am a 32 year-old Junior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am currently majoring in <a href="https://www.umass.edu/hfa/departments/english" target="_blank">English</a> with specializations in <a href="https://www.umass.edu/pwtc/index.html" target="_blank"> Professional Writing and Technical Communication</a><a href="https://www.umass.edu/english/creative-writing-specialization" target="_blank"> Creative Writing</a> and the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/aes/degreescertificates/campus-certificate" target="_blank"> Arts Extension Services</a>. I am also a fiction editor for the UMass Amherst Jabberwocky literary magazine.
    <br>
    <br>
    
        Outside of school, I am very passionate about reading. Since I was a child, I'd read anything I could get my hands on. One of my all-time favorite childhood books is <i>Are You There God? It's Me Margaret</i> by Judy Blume. As an adult, my favorite series are Harry Potter and <i>Miss Perigrines Home for Peculiar Children</i>. However, I love all types of genres including, thriller, memoirs, fantasy, historical fiction and creative non-fiction.

        Professionally, I hope to help non-profits by writing grants. I also want to own my own publishing company for marginalized groups of people. Personally, I would love to see more stories about people like me, who live intersectional lives. I am African American, bisexual, married to a woman of color, and I also have an invisible disability. Reading books for people like me, by people like me is something I find very important.
